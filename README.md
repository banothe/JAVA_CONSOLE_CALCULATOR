# JAVA_CONSOLE_CALCULATOR
1.Create methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

3.Use a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user exits.

I have created a java class where i gave class name as Calculator.Java and implemented Scanner object to give input from user and 
to perform multiple calculation action i have used Switch case so that we can perform addition , substraction , multiplication , Division .
As mentioned allow multiple calculation until the user exits for that i have used break keyword at the end so that till the end loop can pass.
